# I really don't know anything
# yes this is a very good idea
#    i -= 1 #now the question is, is this going to keep on going infinitely? hahahha
# oh no poor andreis computer i really hope he isnt going to run this
# btw it wont run infini#tewlvnalksaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
#why not?
#oh wait

# im not sure if florens has numpy imported yet tho not florens andrei i am having a hard time
# well thats a fair point.
# we can also make a new variable and not change that one so it will never exceed a certain value, easy way to break andreis computer

# no it is just doing minus i but that doesnt matter
#but then it does print it once right
#now i think it will not have any problem
#yeah agreed
#logbook time yaaaas

#hahahhahahhhahaha #dont delete this line, it is really important
    
#really hard code i am very proud of this
